I am aware of following issues :

-Sufficient Headers are not passed in request(only useragent is passed) which can lead to ip-blaclist or 403 forbidden
  -can be solved if needed
  
-Minimum words are used for classifying news
  -can be solved if needed
  
-Scrapper may fail if target <class> is changed
  -can be refactored if this error occurs

-News can be common for more than one 'classifying_words' so it may be repeated
  -can be solved by converting lists to set and OneToMany mapping between words and news (as it makes script complicated
                                                                                          and only simple function was asked to create)
